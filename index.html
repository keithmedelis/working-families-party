				The Working Families Party saves its place on the ballot without much support from neighborhoods with working families
			</h1>
			<h4> by Keith Paul Medelis </h4>
			<h4> Friday, December 18 </h4>

			<p class="intro"> New legislation in New York state regarding third parties, required a fight for survival by Working Families Party (WFP) in New York. This required the party to advocate for voters to support President-elect Biden on the
				Working Families Party line.
			</p>
			<p> In a year with massive stakes, a messaging campaign to communicate to voters the necessity to save its place on the ballot was needed. The party would need 2% city-wide support to save itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				This campaign worked. No neighborhood awarded less than 3% support to the party though it is clear from the the data that the WFP has the strongest support in largely white, wealthier neighborhoods in Brooklyn. These constituents are hardly
				the demographic of the WFP that
				advocates for progressive causes that have launched the careers of Representive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Representative-elect Jamaal Bowman (NY-16).
			</p>
			<p> Sochie Nnaemeka, the Working Families Party’s state director for New York, says that the party's abililty to surpass expectations, with over 4.5% average city-wide support, cements their progressive movement. </p>
			<p> “Working people and Black and
				brown communities are historically challenged when we grow in power — and the threat to our ballot line is no different,” she says. </p>
			<p> The party received its lowest support in East New York, a neighborhood with a population that is 64% Black and 30% Hispanic. </p>
